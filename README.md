## A Night Out at BuXa

### Hanan Sukenik

In my past life, I used to own a few bars and restaurants in Tel Aviv. My favorite one was BuXa, which was a combination of an underground club, an art gallery, and a place to eat good food.
In this project, I would simulate a customerâ€™s night out at the BuXa. Sort of. The customer will be able to move through the different sections of the venue- the bar, the main floor, the art gallery, the outside lounge and even the restroom.

Through this project, we will:

- Use Object-Oriented Programming to create classes and functions 
- Create an interactive command-line game

The project includes two files:

- buxa.py - A Python file containing the code
- Hanan_Sukenik_Project1_Design.pdf - Project report


Enjoy!
